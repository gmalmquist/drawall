# drawall
This is a CAD tool for making quick and easy mockups of floor plans. It's a static web app.

It's designed to support fuzzy constraints given imprecise measurementsâ€”because we've all had the experience of taking a thousand measurements, then trying to draw it up and finding that the inches don't *quite* add up! Or trying to plan a move based off of vague dimensions provided by a landlord.

This is a hobby project; I make no guarantees of future maintenance, functionality, or quality. You can use it [here](https://gwenscode.com/drawall) or run it yourself!

## constraints
To support imprecise and possibly conflicting measurements, constraints are "soft," and are applied with kinematic spring forces. Currently supported are constraints on the angle of a corner, the length of a wall or ruler, and alignment to the X/Y axes. The strength of constraints can be controlled with tension sliders.

Individual wall corners can also be locked in place (this is a hard constraint).

## development
### setup
Simple and absurd, because I've thus far avoided doing things properly (eg using webpack) for _reasons_ (I spent too long professionally maintaining build systems, and now it doesn't give me any dopamine). Requires python3 and tsc on the path.

I like to run `test-server.py` to spin up a basic a web server served at http://localhost:8234, which calls `build.sh` automatically whenever the page is refreshed, and returns a plaintext page of compiler errors (if there are any). Yeah. It's silly.

Or you can just run `build.sh` yourself, serve the static files with your favorite teeny webserver (`python3 -m http.server` is my go-to, but ofc you could also use `caddy` or smth). It's just a static site, so there's no actual backend to spin up.

Note that for the files for which order matters, the order is determined by the list hardcoded in `build.sh`.

### tech debt
Much of the initial development was written feverishly on little sleep, resulting in some less than ideal code quality. I'd like to (1) add a proper build system / webpack / etc, (2) add literally any unit tests, and (3) do lots of cleanup (in that order).

### dependencies
the only actual library dependency currently is [minewt](https://github.com/kanwren/minewt), a very minimal newtype library with no runtime overhead.
